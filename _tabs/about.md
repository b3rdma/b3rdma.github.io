## About Me

Hello, I am Steve 'Zed' Muir. I am married to my wonderful best friend, Yasmin
and we have a beautiful boy, Stanley.

I love to learn and I'm fortunate enough to work for a company that invests in
training their personnel. I try to learn as much as possible everyday but I also
very much appreciate a balance of quality family time.

After a very successful 22 year career in the British Army, I tried to start a
new career in cybersecurity. After almost a year of attending courses, chasing
certifications, and investing a lot of money in equipment, it became clear that
I was not going to achieve what I was hoping for. A good learning experience
nonetheless, and I'm glad I did it.

Now I am working as a risk engineer on a multi-billion pound project. I am
learning new things about risk management all the time even though I have spent
well over a decade managing operational risk. I have also been selected to do an
apprenticeship which will culminate in a Level 3 Data Technician award. In 2026
I will be starting APM Risk Management certifications to enhance my
capabilities.

As of 12 March 2025 I am officially CompTIA Security+ certified. Link to [Credly profile](https://www.credly.com/users/steve-muir.ee8d03c6) to confirm certification.

As of 4 April 2025 I officially hold the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity
certification. Clink on the image below and it will verify that the
certification has been awarded to me.

Although I did enjoy learning about cybersecurity and networking, I doubt that
I shall pursue any further certifications or courses in this area; not enough
time to learn everything as much as I'd love to. Instead, I am looking to become
an expert in advanced Microsoft Excel usage as well as Power BI. In the next 24
months I also plan to master the use of Safran for risk modelling.

I hope to change the direction of this blog which was initially a way for me to
capture some of my learning; practicing writing about TryHackMe rooms, taking
some notes of notable learning points on certain courses, and other interesting
things that I stumbled across.

Now, the plan is to capture more about the subjects of risk management, data
analysis, tips for tools I commonly use (such as Excel, Power BI, and RiskHive),
and other project management tidbits that I find interesting.

If you happen to come across any posts of mine, please feel free to comment and
share any insights you have. I firmly believe that we can all learn from each
other and sharing is caring.

Peas & Love

Zed
