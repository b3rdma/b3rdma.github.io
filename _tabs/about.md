I'm learning about networking, cyber security and anything computing related. I
try to learn as much as possible everyday but I also very much appreciate a
balance of quality family time. 

Looking to work remotely to maximise that family time and continue my studies.
Currently working towards the CompTIA Security+ and Network+ exams as well as
the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) exam. Once time permits I shall sit the Cisco
Certified Network Associate (CCNA) exam as I have already attended the course.

Learning about networking and cybersecurity has been a great learning path so
far and the journey has shown that there is ***a lot*** to learn. This blog is a
way for me to record my notes, practice a bit of web and markdown coding, and if
I'm lucky some others may even benefit from them. 

If you're on Try Hack Me, hit me up with a friend request.
