Hello, I am Steve 'Zed' Muir. I am aspiring to make my way in the cybersecurity
landscape. I am married to my wonderful best friend, Yasmin and we have a
beautiful boy, Stanley. He keeps us busy as he approaches his second birthday.

I love to learn and I'm learning about networking, cybersecurity, and anything
computing related. I try to learn as much as possible everyday but I also very
much appreciate a balance of quality family time.

After deciding to transition to a career in cybersecurity, I initially thought
the idea of being an ethical hacker sounded great and it really is very
interesting. However, with my background in Risk Management, Mitigation and
ensuring adherence to policy/governance, I find myself really enjoying learning
the Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) side of cybersecurity.

Looking to work remotely as much as possible to maximise that family time and
continue developing myself professionally.

As of 12 March 2025 I am officially CompTIA Security+ certified.

As of 4 April 2025 I officially hold the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity
certification. Clink on the image below and it will verify that the
certification has been awarded to me.

I shall use this as a steppingstone to advance in the field of Governance, Risk,
and Compliance (GRC). I will be working towards getting the CISSP
certification/associate whilst continuing to study for other upcoming exams.

Currently working towards the CompTIA Network+ exam and the Certified Ethical
Hacker (CEH) exam. I am considering to prepare for the Cisco Certified Network
Associate (CCNA) exam as I have already attended the course; my focus however,
will be more GRC aligned.

Learning about networking and cybersecurity has been a great learning path so
far and the journey has shown that there is **_a lot_** to learn. This blog is a
way for me to record some notes, practice a bit of web/markdown coding, and if
I'm lucky some others may even benefit from them.

If you're on Try Hack Me, hit me up with a friend request. I try to keep active
on there and hope to break into the top 5000 in 2025, time permitting.
