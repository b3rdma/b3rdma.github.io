I'm learning about networking, cyber security and anything computing related. I
try to learn as much as possible everyday but I also very much appreciate a
balance of quality family time.

Looking to work remotely to maximise that family time and continue my studies.
As of 12 March 2025 I am officially CompTIA Security+ certified and have been
awarded the use of the logo.

Currently working towards the CompTIA Network+ exam and the Certified Ethical
Hacker (CEH) exam. Once time permits I shall sit the Cisco Certified Network
Associate (CCNA) exam as I have already attended the course.

Learning about networking and cybersecurity has been a great learning path so
far and the journey has shown that there is **_a lot_** to learn. This blog is a
way for me to record my notes, practice a bit of web and markdown coding, and if
I'm lucky some others may even benefit from them.

If you're on Try Hack Me, hit me up with a friend request.
